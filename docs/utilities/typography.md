# Typography

These classes can be used to change the way your text looks.

## Color

`.text-white` - Changes the text color to white.

`.text-light` - Changes the text color to white also.

`.text-black` - Changes the text color to black.

`.text-dark` - Changes the text color to a lighter shade than black. (#333)

**Simple Usage**

```html
<div class="bg-light">
  <h1 class="text-dark">Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

Most likely the usage above for a `.text-dark` would be when your background is white. But by default, on light backgrounds, we have implemented a dark text.
